title: About
---

<p>I like to write. Whether it is writing poetry, short stories, essays, a mathematical proof or coding <i>a bit</i>, it does not really matter to me. My published software projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fiedlr">GitHub</a>. The point of this site, on the other hand, is to share some of my readable ideas with the world, although I have no expectations anyone will ever read them.</p>
  
<p>Right now I am not focused on anything particular besides finishing my studies at <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz">FI MUNI</a>. When it comes to computer science, I am mostly interested in <em>automata theory</em>. My three programming languages of choice would be Haskell, Javascript and C++ (in order). Overall, I am interested in far too many things, sometimes I wish it was to the contrary. More information can be found in my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/fiedlr">CV</a>.
  
<p>If you had been intrigued by what I do, an unlikely event happened and I would be more than glad to hear your opinion! Just drop me an <a href="mailto:info@fiedlr.sk">e-mail</a> or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/fiedlr">@fiedlr</a>.</p>
